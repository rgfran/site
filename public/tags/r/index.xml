      <description>If youâ€™re interested in using R and RStudio to teach statistics, one of the biggest issues is installing and getting started with R. I use RStudio, which is an IDE for R (basically, a shell that runs on top of R and makes it easier to use). But installing R and then installing RStudio can be a bit of a hassle.
This is where I found https://rstudio.cloud, a great way to check out what R is like.</description>

      <description>I discovered sentiment analysis a few years ago, following interesting work by Matthew Jockers and Julia Silge. Sentiment analysis is a way to compare the emotional content of text by analyzing the frequency of certain words that reflect different emotions. This could be positivity or negativity or the use of specific emotional words.
One idea I wanted to do was analyze the sentiment of the Christian Bible. But before exploring this, I had a question: which version should I use?</description>
