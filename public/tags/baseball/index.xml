      <description>This is an analysis of how different voters vote for the baseball Hall of Fame, using cluster analysis using 2018 data.
The main motivation for this analysis is to examine patterns in voting, in order to see what kind of voters exist. I wanted to use a dataset to explore cluster analysis and try to teach myself this technique. The idea was to find a dataset where I had a hypothesis about what kind of clusters to expect, then to examine whether those clusters were there.</description>
