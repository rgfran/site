      <description>In a previous entry, I looked at how different voters voted for different candidates for the baseball Hall of Fame, as a way of learning cluster analysis. I found four distinct types of voters.
Now I wanted to see what kind of candidates there were, and whether there were distinct candidates. This is a flip of the analysis in the previous entry. Please read that for more details about how the Hall of Fame works and where the data come from.</description>

      <description>This is an analysis of how different voters vote for the baseball Hall of Fame, using cluster analysis using 2018 data.
The main motivation for this analysis is to examine patterns in voting, in order to see what kind of voters exist. I wanted to use a dataset to explore cluster analysis and try to teach myself this technique. The idea was to find a dataset where I had a hypothesis about what kind of clusters to expect, then to examine whether those clusters were there.</description>

      <title>Teaching R with RStudio Cloud</title>

      <description>If youâ€™re interested in using R and RStudio to teach statistics, one of the biggest issues is installing and getting started with R. I use RStudio, which is an IDE for R (basically, a shell that runs on top of R and makes it easier to use). But installing R and then installing RStudio can be a bit of a hassle.
This is where I found https://rstudio.cloud, a great way to check out what R is like.</description>

      <title>Sentiment analysis in the Bible</title>

      <description>I discovered sentiment analysis a few years ago, following interesting work by Matthew Jockers and Julia Silge. Sentiment analysis is a way to compare the emotional content of text by analyzing the frequency of certain words that reflect different emotions. This could be positivity or negativity or the use of specific emotional words.
One idea I wanted to do was analyze the sentiment of the Christian Bible. But before exploring this, I had a question: which version should I use?</description>

      <description>First post Welcome to the blog. Here, I want to provide a place to post whatever interesting thoughts I have about data, psychology, philosophy, and whatever educational resources I can find. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed resources for R elsewhere on the site, but I will post whatever I find interesting here.
If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you may be my student, (because I made you read it!), or someone who found this through something else.</description>
