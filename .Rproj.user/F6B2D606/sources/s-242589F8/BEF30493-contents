# First post

Welcome to the blog. Here, I want to provide a place to post whatever interesting thoughts I have about data, psychology, philosophy, and whatever educational resources I can find. I've listed resources for R elsewhere on the site, but I will post whatever I find interesting here.

If you're reading this, you may be my student, (because I made you read it!), or someone who found this through something else. However, the idea is still the same. I'm hoping to create a conversation to provide interesting things that don't exactly fit in a class setting, or in a published work, or somewhere else. As always, let me know if you have any interesting ideas.
