# Biography

I am a professor of psychology. This means I spend my time teaching about the mind, statistics, and philosophy, when I'm not administrating things. My academic passions include: guiding whatever research topics my students like, connecting the history of philosophy to psychology, teaching statistics using R, and finding new ways to connect knowledge and life.   

When I'm not in the classroom, I like to grow plants, hike in the woods, build things out of wood, and write.

Please check out the website, which has a blog, teaching materials for R and statistics, and other links.
