If you're interested in using R and RStudio to teach statistics, one of the biggest issues is installing and getting started with R. I use RStudio, which is an IDE for R (basically, a shell that runs on top of R and makes it easier to use). But installing R and then installing RStudio can be a bit of a hassle.

This is where I found [https://rstudio.cloud](RStudio Cloud), a great way to check out what R is like. In only a couple of minutes you will have this, a full-fledged RStudio installation to use, and it's online. It is in alpha mode now, and so it may change at any minute, but it's a great way to check out RStudio, especially if you don't have a computer which can accomodate R, such as an iPad.

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/rstudio_cloud_example.png')
```

So here's how you do it:

1. Go to [https://rstudio.cloud](RStudio Cloud) and set up an account

2. Once you do this, you can start your own space. Each space is a set of related projects, each of which have their own options. The recommended workflow in RStudio cloud is that each space would be a group to collaborate, like a class, and each project would be equivalent to an assignment.

3. Once you make a space, then you can set up your own project. After you add the project, click on the project, and you are brought to your own RStudio window to try out.

4. The best part of this is that you can share spaces. For instance, you can check out the space I created here for my [Stats Class](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/2101/join?access_code=Z%2FmsxjgsuoPOmww1K9HRWH4RG6uLYuxUPRDuLsJM).
